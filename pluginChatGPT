General informations:

ChatGPT have implemented initial support for plugins.
Plugins are tools designed specifically for language models with safety as a core principle, and help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, run computations, or use third-party services.

Retrieve real-time information; e.g., sports scores, stock prices, the latest news, etc.
Retrieve knowledge-base information; e.g., company docs, personal notes, etc.
Assist users with actions; e.g., booking a flight, booking experiences, ordering food, etc.

GetYourGuide 
The GetYourGuide plugin is a tool that help AI, to retrieve the real-time data from the GYG platform.

It doesn't interact with a specific database. Instead, it communicates with the GYG API.

Here's what the GYG plugin can do:

Search for Activities: The plugin may look for activities in a certain area and display a list of available experiences. It can filter results based on a variety of criteria such as date, category, price range, and more.
Provide Detailed Information: The plugin can provide detailed information for each activity, such as the title, description, price, availability, and a link to the booking page. It can also provide data on reviews and ratings.
Check Availability: The plugin can determine whether or not specified activities are available on a given date and time.
It is crucial to remember, however, that while the GYG plugin may give information and verify availability, it cannot make bookings. To complete their bookings, users must go to the GYG portal.

The GetYourGuide plugin doesn't have any mandatory parameters.
